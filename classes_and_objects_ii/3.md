In Line 9, we invoke the `name=` method on the object pointed at by the local variable `bob`, passing as argument the string `"Bob"`. But we have not defined any such method on the object. (We have defined a reader method but not a writer method.)

We can fix it by changing `attr_reader` to `attr_accessor`, thus generating a writer method for setting the value of the instance variable `@name`.
